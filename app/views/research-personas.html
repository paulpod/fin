      <p>John is interested in trading as he sees it as a way of making money quickly. He is reasonably knowledgeable but lacks ‘probabilistic thinking’, meaning that he puts too much emphasis on individual trades, leading to cutting gains and running losses.</p>
      
      <p>He has been stuck in this pattern since early on. He has an unrealistically positive view of his ability because he tends to focus on his wins more than his losses, which he often puts down to bad luck.</p>

      <div class="personabox" style="background-color:#acdafe">
      <p>Like all Aspiring traders, John has become stuck in a pattern of trading that causes him to consistently lose money.</p>

      <p>While he only carries out superficial analysis and relies to a large extent on instinct, others in this segment will be more systematic.</p>

      <p>However, like John most of them will lack discipline and so still end up losing money.</p>
