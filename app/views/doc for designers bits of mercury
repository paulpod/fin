Areas that need fleshing out in more depth, either as wireframes or full pixel mockups:

- Watchlists

There is only one watchlist view drawn up, unlike the mockups for Open Positions and Active Orders the expanded view to each table line has not been worked up.

- what are the essential items that need to be included in a detail view?
- what gets left out?

Also the management of multiple watchlists has not been looked at, apart from the hamburger menu

- what would be in the menu? Could we get rid of it?
- How do I create a new watchlist?
- How do I switch between watchlists?
- How do I add/remove items to a watchlist
- Can I move items between watchlists? Or Copy?
- Can I share a watchlist? What does that look like?
- How do I name and rename a watchlist?
- How do I get rid of a watchlist?


- News

There is one drawing of how news works, with a set of 'tabbed' links across the top, a column of story headlines + summaries and one big story. It's not been worked out in any more detail.

- what would be a usable primary/secondary news taxonomy structure that wouldn't require a third layer?
- how do items get added to the tabs? Can they be removed? Reordered?
- reading a news story, is the position remembered if I switch 'tabs'?
- can I bookmark or share a news story? What does the link go to?
- How do I leave multiple news stories either open, tagged or bookmarked to come back to?
- How does a chart, prices and deal ticket appear "in context" of news?
- There is also going to be a personalised news feed, automatically generated from a user's activity/watchlists. How does this look? Different?


- Profile / User history

WE may want to add a social trading element in the future, this hasn't been looked at at all. What would a user profile look like?

- could it show open trades (not detailed? some level of vagueness) so as not to reward users who keep open losing trades in a social trade context?
- If a user wants to provide commentary to trades, is that possible?

- Can we provide the user with a visual history of their trades/funding/entries and exists to the market? Can we provide trading advice? What does this look like?

- Can we provide historical advice: "what if you hadn't sold *here* but held for another hour?" What does this look like? what is the contet for discovery of this?
